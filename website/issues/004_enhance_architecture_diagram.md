# Enhance Architecture Diagram

**Status:** Open
**Priority:** Low
**Tags:** design, ux, wow-factor

## Description
Make the "Architecture" diagram more dynamic and engaging. Currently, it is a static layout with simple hover effects. Adding animations (e.g., flowing data particles) or interactive elements would better visualize the "Zero-Copy" path and add a "wow" factor.

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Design a dynamic version of the architecture diagram.
- [ ] Implement animations using CSS or a lightweight JS library.
- [ ] Ensure it remains accessible and performant.
