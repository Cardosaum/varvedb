**Status:** Closed
**Priority:** Medium
**Tags:** accessibility, a11y, design

## Description
Ensure color contrast ratios, especially for grey text on dark backgrounds, meet WCAG AA standards. The "dimmed" state in the architecture diagram and some footer text might be too low contrast.

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Audit color contrast using an accessibility tool (e.g., Lighthouse, WAVE).
- [ ] Adjust colors to meet WCAG AA requirements.
