# Style mdbook to Match Main Site

**Status:** Open
**Priority:** Medium
**Tags:** design, documentation

## Description
If not migrating to a unified framework immediately, style the existing `mdbook` to *exactly* match the main website (same header, footer, fonts, and colors). This reduces the disjointed feeling between the marketing site and the docs.

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Create a custom theme for `mdbook`.
- [ ] Apply the website's CSS variables and fonts to the book.
- [ ] Replicate the website header/footer in the book's HTML templates.
